# This is the Storm Candidate Technical Test

The test is designed to allow you to show us your knowledge and experience within a plausible web application scenerio.

To get started either download the current latest release or fork the repository and work from there.

Once you have a local copy of the code, open Visual Studio, build and run the solution, if all is well you will see the introduction and a list of tasks to consider.

You can choose whether to complete the tasks sequentially or out of sequence, or whether you complete all the available tasks.  Some tasks are designed to test more experienced developers, so we will not be expecting all candidates to have completed all the tasks.

*Task 999* as the name implies is very much optional and if you choose to give this a go we will likely be very impressed, but it is not something we are expecting, we might discuss your thoughts on how you would implement this during any interview however.
